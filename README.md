## Metroid ROM Extractor

This is an Android app that will extract a copy of the NES version of Metroid using the "NESemu.rel" or "NESemuP.rel" file from your legitimate backup copy of Metroid Prime.

Currently, this will only extract the NES Metroid ROM using the USA version of Metroid Prime, and will not extract the FDS version of Metroid.  The "NESemu.rel" file must be pre-extracted from the ISO using Dolphin, Gamecube ISO Tool, or similar tools.
