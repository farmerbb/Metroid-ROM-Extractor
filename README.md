## Metroid ROM Extractor

This is an Android app that will extract a copy of the NES version of Metroid using the "NESemu.rel" or "NESPAL60emu.rel" file from your legitimate backup copy of Metroid Prime.

Currently, this will extract the NES Metroid ROM using the following versions of Metroid Prime:

* USA (v1.00 or v1.02)
* Europe (v1.00)

The "NESemu.rel" or "NESPAL60emu.rel" file must be pre-extracted from the ISO using Dolphin, Gamecube ISO Tool, or similar tools.

For a command-line version of this tool, see https://gitlab.com/vaiski/decryptmetroid
